The transportation network consists of various modes, ranging from roadways and railways to air travel, ensuring accessibility and facilitating movement within the country.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        **1. Road Transport: The road network in Macedonia is well-developed, comprising highways, national roads, and local roads. The primary highway that traverses the country is the North-South Corridor, connecting the capital city of Skopje to Thessaloniki in Greece. This corridor plays a crucial role in regional trade and tourism.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The local road network reaches into rural areas, providing access to smaller towns and picturesque destinations. However, some roads may be narrow and winding, especially in mountainous regions. Careful driving and adherence to local traffic rules are important.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        **2. <a href="https://mzt.mk/" target="_blank">Rail Transport</a>: Macedonia has a rail system that connects key cities and towns. The rail network, operated by the state-owned Macedonian Railways (MZ), offers an alternative mode of travel. Trains are generally affordable and can be a scenic way to experience the country's landscapes.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        **3. Public Buses: Public buses, operated by various companies, are a common mode of transport for both short and long distances. They provide an extensive network that connects urban and rural areas, making it convenient to explore different parts of the country.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        **4. Air Travel: The main international airport is Skopje International Airport, located near the capital city. This airport serves as the primary entry point for international travelers. Additionally, Ohrid St. Paul the Apostle Airport is another international airport located near Lake Ohrid, a popular tourist destination.

        **6. <a href="https://zk.mk/taksi-kompanii/skopje">Taxis</a>: Taxis are widely available in urban areas and can be hailed on the street or booked through phone apps. Always ensure the taxi has a meter or agree on a fare before starting the journey.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        **7. Transportation Challenges: While the transportation infrastructure has improved, there may still be some challenges. Some rural areas might have limited transport options, and road conditions can vary. It's important to plan your routes and check schedules in advance, especially when traveling to less-frequented destinations.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        **8. Travel Tips: Research and familiarize yourself with the local transportation options before your trip. If you plan to explore rural areas or less-touristy regions, consider renting a car for more flexibility. Local transportation schedules might vary, so it's a good practice to double-check timings, especially for buses and trains.
