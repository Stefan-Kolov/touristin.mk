                Understanding the cost of living and expenses in a foreign country is essential for a comfortable and enjoyable trip. Here's a guide to prices in Macedonia to help you plan your budget effectively:
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                1. Accommodation: Accommodation prices can vary widely depending on the type of lodging and location. In cities like Skopje and Ohrid, you'll find a range of options from budget hostels to luxury hotels. On average, a mid-range hotel room might cost around 40 to 60 Euros per night.            </p>
            <p class="text">
                2. Food and Dining: Dining out in Macedonia is relatively affordable, especially when compared to Western Europe. A meal at a mid-range restaurant could cost around 15 to 20 Euros. Street food and local eateries offer even more budget-friendly options.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                3. Transportation: Public transportation fares are reasonable. A bus or tram ride within the city might cost around 0.70 to 1 Euro. Taxi fares start at around 1 Euro, with additional charges per kilometer.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                4. Entrance Fees: Entrance fees to museums, historical sites, and attractions vary. On average, you might expect to pay around 3 to 5 Euros for a museum ticket, while entrance to major historical sites like the Skopje Fortress might cost around 5 to 8 Euros.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                5. Shopping: Prices for everyday items like groceries and clothing are generally affordable. Local markets offer fresh produce at reasonable rates. Keep in mind that prices for branded and imported items might be higher.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                6. Entertainment and Activities: Going to the cinema or attending a local event won't break the bank. Tickets for movies might cost around 3 to 5 Euros, while cultural events might have varying price ranges.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                7. Currency Exchange: The local currency is the Macedonian Denar (MKD). Exchange rates can fluctuate, so it's a good idea to check current rates before making currency exchanges.            <p class="text">
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                8. Tipping: Tipping is customary in Macedonia. In restaurants, leaving around 10% of the bill as a tip is appreciated. Tipping for good service in cafes, bars, and taxis is also common.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                9. Budget Travel: For budget travelers, it's possible to get by on around 30 to 40 Euros per day, staying in hostels, eating at local eateries, and using public transportation.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                10. Festivals and Special Events: Prices for festivals and special events can vary widely. It's best to check event-specific pricing and book tickets in advance if possible.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                11. Bargaining: Bargaining is common in markets and smaller shops, but it's generally not practiced in larger stores and established businesses.
